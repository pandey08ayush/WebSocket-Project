Project Description: Simple WebSocket Room Connection

This project demonstrates the creation of a basic application using WebSockets to enable real-time communication. It allows users to create rooms and establish connections within those rooms for seamless interaction. By leveraging the WebSocket protocol, this project facilitates bi-directional, low-latency communication between connected clients.

Key Features:
Room Creation:

Users can create unique rooms where participants can join.
Each room acts as an isolated channel for communication.
Real-Time Connectivity:

Users can join existing rooms via WebSocket.
Once connected, users can send and receive messages in real time within the room.
WebSocket Protocol:

Utilizes WebSocket for persistent, full-duplex communication.
Ensures efficient data exchange with minimal overhead compared to HTTP-based polling.
Use Case:
This application can be extended for chat rooms, collaborative tools, gaming lobbies, or any scenario requiring real-time multi-user communication.
